        Ask user for minimum, maximum (inclusive) and how many (count) random numbers user wants to generate.
        Makes sure minimum is not larger than maximum and count is not negative.
        Display error message if inputs are invalid.
        If all is fine then generate the random numbers and print them out, comma-separated on a single line.
        Example session:
        Enter minumum: 5
        Enter maximum: 10
        How many to generate? 3
        Random numbers: 6, 9, 10
